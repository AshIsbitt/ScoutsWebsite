# Scouts Website

## What is this
This is a complete sample website developed with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript with a usecase of running for my local scouts group. The site makes use of the Bootstrap library for parts of its layout as well. 

The purpose of the website is for advertising, communication, and showcasing the different age ranges and activities that the site offers. 

Note that the previous repo for this project was pulled as files needed editing to remove overly sensetive information
